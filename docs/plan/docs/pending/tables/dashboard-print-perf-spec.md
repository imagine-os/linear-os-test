# Lazy loading, error boundaries, print route, page-spec hook and permission tiles

**Goal**

Make dashboards fast, printable and embeddable from page specs, with graceful failure per block.

**Scope**

In: lazy block loading, per-block error boundary and skeleton, `/print/d/:id` (A4 and Letter), `layout.dashboard` in `page.spec.yaml` (PAP-120), "No access" tiles, refresh interval.

**Spec**

* Blocks load as they scroll into view; 12-block dashboard settles under 2 s on the seed tenant; refresh min 30 s with "updated n s ago".
* Print route renders without chrome; map blocks as static images; used by PAP-183 exports.
* Viewers see "No access" tiles for views they cannot read.

**Interface contract**

Provides: print route, `layout.dashboard` codegen hook, `BlockErrorBoundary`. Consumes: both sibling children, PAP-120, Playwright print (PAP-82 image).

**Definition of done**

* Performance trace attached; permission test; PDF snapshot; docs `docs/views/dashboards.md`.

**Test plan**

* Integration: settle time on seed; PDF page count.
* E2E: viewer without access sees the tile; block error does not break the page.

**Demo**

Print `/demo/dashboard` to PDF and open it.

**Edge cases**

* WebGL absent in print: list fallback.

**Dependencies**

Sibling children (hard), PAP-120 (soft).

**Agent**

Builder: Nova. Reviewer: Sentinel.

**Size**

S: half a session.

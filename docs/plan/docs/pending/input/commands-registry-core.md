# Command registry core, scoping and chord matcher

**Goal**

Build the heart of PAP-151: `defineCommand`, a registry with a scope stack, chord and sequence matching on PAP-150's `Chord`, `when` guards, conflict warnings and a build-time manifest that fails on duplicate IDs.

**Scope**

In:

* `packages/input/src/commands/`: `defineCommand({ id, title, description?, icon?, keywords?, scope, shortcut?, when?, permission?, argsSchema?, agentCallable?, voice?, run })`, `CommandRegistry { register, unregister, execute, list, setBindingsResolver }`, hooks `useCommand`, `useCommands`, `useShortcut`.
* `CommandScopeProvider` scope stack (global → page route id → focused component); innermost match wins.
* Matcher: chords, sequences (`g i`, 1 s timeout), platform display, browser-reserved warnings, `allowInInput` guard.
* `pnpm commands:manifest` → `commands.manifest.json`; Vitest fails on duplicate IDs.

Out: palette UI (sibling 2), agent endpoint and defaults (sibling 3).

**Spec**

* IDs dot-namespaced; `when(ctx)` receives `{ route, selection, focusedScope, permissions, capabilities, isEditing }`.
* `permission` checked with `can()`; hidden commands excluded from `list`.
* Letters matched on `event.code`, symbols on `event.key`.

**Interface contract**

Exposes the API above, `CommandDef` and `CommandContext` types, `commands.manifest.json` schema, `setBindingsResolver` seam for PAP-153. Consumes `parseChord`, `matchChord`, `formatChord` (PAP-150), `can()` (PAP-227), spec `commands:` section (PAP-114, optional).

**Definition of done**

* Registry used by a sample page with spec-declared commands; manifest committed; Linear comment with test summary.

**Test plan**

* Vitest: chord parsing on macOS and Linux mocks, sequences and timeout, scope precedence with sibling scopes, `when` guards, `allowInInput` inside a contenteditable, duplicate-ID failure, permission hiding, reserved-chord warning, non-Latin layout matching.
* Bench: `list()` over 2,000 commands under 2 ms.

**Demo**

In the sample page press `g i` and watch navigation; register a duplicate ID in a scratch file and run `pnpm commands:manifest` to see the failure. Under two minutes.

**Edge cases**

* Async `run` throws: error toast hook, registry healthy.
* Same chord in sibling scopes: focused wins.

**Dependencies**

PAP-150 (hard). PAP-59, PAP-114 (soft). Blocks siblings 2 and 3.

**Agent**

**Size**

M: the core API and matcher with a wide unit suite.

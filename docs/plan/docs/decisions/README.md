# Decisions

Architecture Decision Records (Nygard style: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives rejected) for the build loop itself — process and infrastructure choices the coordinating session made while running the PaperOS plan on autopilot. These are separate from the plan's own pre-assigned ADR register (`docs/module-system.md` and the builder brief list ADR 0001..0025, which live in the product repositories under `docs/adr/`); this folder's numbering is its own sequence, starting at 0001.

# Platform documents

> Location: `docs/plan/docs/` in the monorepo `imagine-os/linear-os-test` (formerly the repository
> `imagine-os/linear-builder`). The code these documents plan is in the same repository: the platform
> template at the root (former `paperos-template`, `imagine-os/empty-11`) and the orchestrator at
> `tools/orchestrator` (former `paperos-orchestrator`, `imagine-os/empty12`). The Blueprint site
> (`../site/`) is published at https://imagine-os.github.io/linear-os-test/blueprint/.

Markdown sources of the documents published to Linear (workspace `paperos`). Read them in the order the table gives. The Linear copy is the one sessions link to; these files are the same text at the time of the last edit (round 4, 2026-09-18).

## Pending-issue documents

`pending/` holds one file per round-2 pending issue. All of them were created in Linear on 2026-09-17 as PAP-280..PAP-432 (team PAP now holds 428 issues); the key-to-identifier table in [`pending/README.md`](pending/README.md) maps each `[project/key]` citation to its PAP identifier, and the live Linear description (mirrored in `../specs/`) wins over the historical text here. Linear also holds the same text as eleven "Round 2 pending issues" documents:

| Project(s) | Linear document |
|---|---|
| agents (9) | https://linear.app/paperos/document/round-2-pending-issues-agents-9-85624b15630d |
| pm-linear (9) | https://linear.app/paperos/document/round-2-pending-issues-pm-linear-9-d4829fc00859 |

| security (11) | https://linear.app/paperos/document/round-2-pending-issues-security-11-27d8ebfcd8d0 |

The app-shell/data-layer/forge gap issues and the collab/realtime/input pending issues have no Linear document; their historical copies are the files here and the source JSON in `../plan/round2/`, and their live text is the PAP issue named in [`pending/README.md`](pending/README.md).

## Build loop

Documents from the autopilot build loop (from 2026-09-19), kept separate from the planning-round documents above because they record execution, not the plan itself.

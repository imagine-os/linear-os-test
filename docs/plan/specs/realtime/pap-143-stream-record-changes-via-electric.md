# PAP-143: Stream record changes via Electric shapes to all connected clients and reconcile with local writes

**Model / Effort:** set on children (umbrella is never claimed)

**Goal**

Umbrella: make every table, list and detail page update live when any human or agent changes a record, without per-feature socket code. Electric shapes (PAP-270, PAP-271) stream rows into PGlite; this issue reconciles them with optimistic writes and tells the UI when data changed under it. Planned as three work packages; the umbrella owns the lag measurement and docs.

**Scope**

Work packages (build in order; each becomes a child issue once the Linear issue limit is lifted, see the pinned comment):

1. **Live record hooks and shape registry additions** — `useRecord`, `useRecordChanges`, reference-counted subscriptions on top of PAP-271's `useShape`/`useLiveQuery`, shape entries for `records`, `fields`, `views` (PAP-161) and PM entities (PAP-100) with tenant and permission predicates, per-frame batching, LRU cap of 50 shapes.
2. **Reconciler for optimistic writes and conflict events** — `mutation_id` and `updated_by` stamping in PAP-35 middleware, `_pending` rows, echo matching, `expect` comparison, `conflict` event emission consumed by PAP-144 and PAP-148.
3. **Permission-driven resubscribe and lag measurement** — `409 shape-invalid` handling, drop and resubscribe, dev inspector `window.__paperosSync`, Playwright lag test with Electric in CI.

Parent owns `docs/platform/realtime/record-sync.md` with data-flow diagram, staging lag measurement and the grid demo page.

Out: transport (PAP-270), Yjs documents, retry policy (PAP-148), conflict visuals (PAP-144).

**Spec**

* Libraries `@electric-sql/client` 1.x, `@electric-sql/pglite` 0.3.x with `live`, `@electric-sql/react`; shapes through `/api/sync/shape` with the session (PAP-270).
* Lag budget 500 ms p95 on staging; ordering by server `lsn`, never client clocks.
* Shapes unsubscribe 30 s after the last consumer unmounts.

**Interface contract**

Exposes: `useRecord(table, id)`, `useRecordChanges(id) -> { changedFields, actor, at } | null`, `subscribeShape(def) -> unsubscribe`, `ShapeDef { table, where, columns? }` registry `registerShape()`, `mutate(proc, input, { optimistic, expect })` extension, event `sync.conflict { recordId, table, conflictingFields, mine, theirs, actor, at }` and `sync.remoteChange { recordId, changedFields, actor }` on a local `EventTarget` in `packages/sync/events.ts`, inspector shape `{ shapes[], lagMs, outboxLength }`. Consumes: `useShape`, `useLiveQuery`, PGlite client (PAP-271), shape proxy and predicates (PAP-270, PAP-228), oRPC middleware hooks for stamping `mutation_id uuid` and `updated_by` (PAP-267), outbox from PAP-272, view model tables (PAP-161), PM tables (PAP-100).

**Definition of done**

* All three work packages merged; grid demo: a cell edited in browser A updates B within 500 ms; screenshot pair at 768 and 1440.
* Integration test with a real Electric container in CI.
* Docs with diagram; changelog; Linear comment with staging demo link and lag measurement.

**Test plan**

* Integration (parent): `ops/compose/test.yml` with Postgres and Electric; Playwright writes via API and polls the DOM in a second context; asserts p95 under 500 ms over 50 writes; revokes a role via `/__test` (PAP-240) and asserts rows disappear within one resubscribe.
* Unit tests per work package (echo match drops optimistic row, mismatch emits conflict with correct fields, out-of-order arrival, duplicate echo idempotent, LRU eviction warning, 409 handling).
* Visual: grid demo captured at 768 and 1440 in both themes with the 5 s change flash.

**Demo**

Open the grid demo in two browsers, edit a cell in one and watch it flash in the other with the actor avatar; go offline in one, edit, come back and see it reconcile; open `window.__paperosSync` in devtools. Under two minutes.

**Edge cases**

* Offline an hour, 300 outbox writes vs 2,000 remote rows: remote first, then replay, conflicts per row.
* Row deleted while editing: keep editor with a "deleted by X" banner and restore via PAP-38.
* 500k-row shape: refused without a bounding predicate.
* Schema migration: PGlite hash mismatch resets with a toast.

**Dependencies**

PAP-36 (hard, encoded; children PAP-270 to PAP-272). Soft: PAP-35, PAP-59, PAP-163, PAP-240. Blocks PAP-144, PAP-148, PAP-147 and the planned push transport; consumed by PAP-165, PAP-102, PAP-131, PAP-136.

**Agent**

Builder: Nova (CRDT Engineer) with Forge (Schema Wright) on stamping columns. Reviewer: Sentinel (Code Reviewer, Edge Case Hunter for ordering).

**Size**

L, planned as three M/S work packages (child issues pending the issue limit).

**Module boundary**

This umbrella is the Multiplayer & Realtime half of the PaperOS Module System (`docs/module-system.md`). The `realtime` module implements `@paperos/contract-realtime` (collab doc rooms, presence, live records and reconciler, push transport, window bus, offline queue status). Collab, tables, canvas and support surfaces open rooms and subscribe to live records only through these ports, never through Yjs, Hocuspocus or Electric clients directly; the module may import `@paperos/core`, `contract-data-layer`, `contract-identity` and its own packages. Its manifest declares `provides: [{ contract: '@paperos/contract-realtime', version: '0.1.0' }]`, `owner: { agent: 'Nova', project: 'realtime' }` and `swapRisk: 'high'`. The contract package is published by PAP-475 (`module/realtime/contract`), proven by PAP-478 (`module/realtime/conformance`) and bound into `@paperos/kernel` by PAP-481 (`module/realtime/wire`); children of this issue inherit this boundary and may not add a dependency the manifest does not declare (lint rules R7 to R11).

# PAP-409: Portal referral page, console program and referral grids and the rewards approval queue

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) / low — Deferred label (excluded from Oct-1 scope)

**Goal**

Give customers a place to share and track, and staff a queue to approve, on top of the referral data model.

**Scope**

In: `_portal/referrals` (code, link, share buttons, status list, rewards, Connect CTA); console programs page, referrals grid, approval queue. Deferred with the parent.

**Spec**

* Portal page uses PAP-64 shell and tenant branding; console grids are PAP-165 views; approval queue shows fraud flags with reasons.

**Interface contract**

Provides: routes above. Consumes: both siblings, PAP-64, PAP-165, PAP-181 onboarding link.

**Definition of done**

* Playwright share flow and approval; screenshots at seven widths in light and dark; permission tests (customers see only their own).

**Test plan**

* E2E: portal share and status; staff approve; customer denied on `/referrals/admin`.

**Demo**

Copy the code from the portal, then approve a reward in the console queue.

**Edge cases**

* Program paused shows a notice on the portal page.

**Dependencies**

Both siblings (hard), PAP-64, PAP-165.

**Agent**

Builder: Beacon. Reviewer: Sentinel (Visual Inspector).

**Size**

S: half a session, deferred.

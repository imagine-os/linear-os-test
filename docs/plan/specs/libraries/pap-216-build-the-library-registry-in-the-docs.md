# PAP-216: Build the library registry in the docs system: adopted, trialing, rejected with reasons and owners

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) / high — Build M

**Goal**

Give PaperOS one place that says what third-party code we use, why, who owns it and where the decision lives: a file-based registry rendered in-app through the docs engine, with a drift check so no dependency appears in a lockfile without an entry and no rejected library creeps back. This is the memory PAP-218, PAP-217 and every research ADR write into.

**Scope**

In:

* Entries `docs/registry/entries/<id>.yaml`, Zod 4 schema `packages/spec/src/libraries/registry.ts`, generated `docs/.generated/registry.json`.
* CLI `pnpm lib add <npm|crate:|image:> --status --owner --adr --category` scaffolding with facts from PAP-209's collector; `pnpm lib registry build|check`.
* Page `/_app/docs/registry` via PAP-128 (MDX plus a small React table): filters by status, category, owner; badges; ADR and scorecard links; "review due".
* Drift check job in Gate 1 (`generated-drift` pattern, PAP-78).
* Seed: every current production dependency as `adopted` with `adr: pending`, plus one Linear issue listing pending ADRs for Atlas.

Out: the ADR system (PAP-130), upgrades (PAP-217), scanning (PAP-218), rendering with the views engine (plain table; swap to PAP-165 later).

**Spec**

* Entry `{ id, name, source: { kind: npm|crate|image|service, ref }, version (from lockfile), status: candidate|trialing|adopted|reference|deprecated|replaced|rejected, category, owner, adr, scorecard, license (verified against PAP-211), context: bundled|server|dev|service (array allowed), usedBy[], alternativesConsidered[], reasons, addedAt, reviewAt, replacedBy?, aliases[], notes }`.
* Build reads `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `Cargo.lock` for `version` and `usedBy`; resolves `adr` against PAP-130's `adr-index.json`, failing on a dangling id, warning and skipping when the index is absent.
* Check rules: production dependency without `adopted` or `trialing` entry (error); `rejected|replaced|deprecated` present in a lockfile (error); `adopted` with no `usedBy` (warning); `reviewAt` past (warning); trivial helpers allowlisted in `docs/registry/trivial.yaml`.
* Transitions enforced by the CLI: `candidate` -> `trialing` -> `adopted` (needs accepted ADR) or `rejected`; `adopted` -> `deprecated` -> `replaced` with `replacedBy`.
* `reviewAt` defaults to `addedAt` plus 180 days; README documents statuses and cadence.

*Round 4 amendment (2026-09-18):*
Entry gains optional `patches[]` (PAP-759), `census` and `swapImpact` (PAP-761) and `cost` (PAP-764, deferred); `version` is read from the pnpm `catalog:` when PAP-756 lands. Check rule: `adopted` without `docs/libraries/notes/<id>.md` warns for 7 days after adoption, then errors.

**Interface contract**

Provides: `RegistryEntrySchema`, `registry.json` `{ generatedAt, entries[], stats: { byStatus, byCategory } }`, CLI commands above, page route, Gate 1 job `registry-drift`, `trivial.yaml`. Consumes: PAP-209 `lib-facts` and scorecard paths, PAP-128 rendering, PAP-130 `adr-index.json` (soft), PAP-78 job slot, PAP-211 `policy.yaml` for license verification. Consumers: PAP-217 (`registry build` post-merge), PAP-218 (`lib add --status candidate`), PAP-79 third-party findings pointer, PAP-212 to PAP-215 entries.

**Definition of done**

* Schema, CLI, build and check merged; seed entries for all production dependencies committed; check passes on `main`; pending-ADR Linear issue exists.
* Drift check runs in Gate 1; a seeded unregistered dependency fails it (screenshot of the red status).
* Page screenshots at 375, 1024 and 1920 in light and dark; axe clean.
* `docs/registry/README.md` and `docs/libraries/registry.md`; CHANGELOG; Linear comment with page link.
* Entries exist for the ADR outputs of PAP-212 to PAP-215 where drafts exist.

**Test plan**

* Vitest: schema, pnpm and Cargo lockfile parsing fixtures, ADR resolution with and without index, every check rule with fixtures, transition enforcement, alias handling, multiple versions warning.
* CI: seeded violation branch fails `registry-drift`; clean `main` passes.
* Playwright: filter by status, open an entry, stacked cards at 375; visual baselines at 375, 1024, 1920 in both themes; axe.

**Demo**

Reviewer runs `pnpm lib add left-pad --status trialing --owner scout --category ui` and sees the scaffolded entry with facts filled, then `pnpm lib registry check` and opens `/_app/docs/registry` filtered to `trialing`. Under two minutes.

**Edge cases**

* Same library in `bundled` and `dev`: one entry, `context` array, strictest rule.
* Renamed or scoped package (`radix-ui` unifying `@radix-ui/*`): `aliases[]`.
* Multiple versions in lockfile: all listed; warning over two.
* `proposed` ADR: fine for `trialing`, error for `adopted`.
* `Cargo.lock` absent before Tauri: Rust checks skipped with notice.

**Dependencies**

PAP-209 and PAP-128 (hard). PAP-211 (license verification). Soft: PAP-130, PAP-78. Blocks PAP-218.

**Agent**

Built by Scout (Library Evaluator) with Quill for the docs page. Reviewed by Sentinel (Code Reviewer, Visual Inspector) and Atlas.

**Size**

M: small schema and page; lockfile parsing, check rules and seeding touch every package.

**Module boundary**

This issue is the Library Discovery & Integration half of the PaperOS Module System (`docs/module-system.md`). The `libraries` module implements `@paperos/contract-libraries` (library record, rubric scores, ADR frontmatter, license policy, MCP connector record, Renovate groups, Scout report). The license gate, Renovate and the Scout routine read the policy and registry only through these schemas; the module may import `@paperos/core`, `contract-collab`, `contract-quality` and its own tooling. Its manifest declares `provides: [{ contract: '@paperos/contract-libraries', version: '0.1.0' }]`, `owner: { agent: 'Scout', project: 'libraries' }` and `swapRisk: 'low'`. The contract package is published by PAP-493 (`module/libraries/contract`), proven by PAP-495 (`module/libraries/conformance`) and bound into `@paperos/kernel` by PAP-497 (`module/libraries/wire`); children of this issue inherit this boundary and may not add a dependency the manifest does not declare (lint rules R7 to R11).

*Round 4 critique fix (2026-09-18):* resolved 4 round-4 file keys in this description to Linear identifiers: `r4/libraries/dependency-hygiene` = PAP-756, `r4/libraries/import-census` = PAP-761, `r4/libraries/library-cost-model` = PAP-764, `r4/libraries/patch-fork-policy` = PAP-759.

# PAP-271: PGlite client, schema generation and read hooks (useShape, useLiveQuery)

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) / high — Build M

**Goal**

Ship `packages/sync` client pieces: `defineShape`, the shape registry, `SyncClient` lifecycle, PGlite 0.3 with IndexedDB and Tauri file persistence, `pnpm gen:pglite` schema generation from Drizzle with hash-based reset, and `useShape` and `useLiveQuery` hooks.

**Scope**

In: client package, generated `schema.sql`, hooks, persistence adapters, core shapes `workspaces`, `memberships`, `users`, `files`, demo route reads.

Out: proxy (child 1), writes (child 3).

**Spec**

* `gen:pglite` emits SQL for registered tables only; hash stored in `_sync_meta`; mismatch resets local data, keeps `_outbox`.
* `useLiveQuery(sql, params)` over PGlite live extension; `useShape(shape)` returns `{ rows, status }`.
* Tauri persistence in app data dir; Android falls back per PAP-31 findings.

**Interface contract**

Provides: `defineShape`, `registerShape`, `useShape`, `useLiveQuery`, `SyncClient`, generated schema file. Consumes: proxy (child 1), ADR decision (PAP-31), `useOnline` (PAP-18). Consumed by PAP-143, PAP-163.

**Definition of done**

* Demo route lists workspaces from PGlite; bench of 2k-row initial load under 1.5 s on CI committed.
* Vitest for registry, hash reset, hooks; screenshots of the demo route at seven widths.

**Test plan**

* Unit: hash reset preserves outbox; hook states loading, ready, error.
* Integration (CI compose with Electric): full shape load into PGlite, live update after a server write appears within 2 s.
* Bench: 2k rows timed.
* Visual: demo route at seven widths.

**Demo**

Reviewer opens `/_app/sync-demo`, sees workspaces load instantly on second visit, edits one in Drizzle Studio and watches the list update live. Under a minute.

**Edge cases**

* Safari private mode: in-memory PGlite with banner.
* Storage above 200 MB: warning and `columns` trimming advice.

*Round 4 amendment (2026-09-18):*
Add: sign-out, session revocation and tenant switch wipe the local PGlite database and `y-indexeddb` stores unless the outbox holds unsent writes and the user keeps them (PAP-572 owns `wipe()`); shapes may declare `cacheable: false` and are then held in memory only; the registry lint refuses `encrypted()` columns in persisted shapes.

**Dependencies**

Child 1 (hard), PAP-31. Blocks child 3.

**Agent**

Built by Forge with Nova. Reviewed by Sentinel.

*Round 4 critique fix (2026-09-18):* resolved 1 round-4 file key in this description to Linear identifiers: `r4/data-layer/local-data-protection` = PAP-572.

# PAP-455: Wire forge behind the module registry with an adapter and feature flag

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 / high

**Goal**

Make `forge` a swappable module in practice: its implementation binds into the `@paperos/kernel` registry as the default adapter for `@paperos/contract-forge`, every consumer resolves the ports from the kernel instead of importing `ops/forgejo, packages/forge (client), .forgejo/workflows`, and a `module.forge.impl` variant flag can select a second implementation per tenant with shadow-run and five-second rollback (`docs/module-system.md` sections 4 and 6). After this issue, rewriting forge touches no other module.

**Scope**

In:

* `packages/<impl>/src/adapter.ts` (or one file per port): classes or factories implementing each port from `@paperos/contract-forge`, registered by `module.ts` `bind(kernel)`; request-scoped ports receive the tenant and actor from the kernel's request scope.
* Consumer migration: every import of `forge` internals from another module (found by `pnpm gen:dep-map --undeclared`) replaced with `kernel.resolve(port)` or a hook from the contract; lint R8 turned from warning to error for this module.
* Flag `module.forge.impl` declared in `flags.yaml` (PAP-366) with variants `default` and `next`; a `next` implementation stub that re-exports the default (so the mechanism is exercised before a real rewrite exists).
* Slot fills and route contributions moved from code into the manifest; event subscriptions declared in `events.subscribes`.
* Shadow mode wiring for the module's read ports (`shadow: true` diffs into `swap_shadow_diff`).

Out: a real second implementation (the shell swap drill covers the shell; others come when a rewrite is proposed); changes to the contract (own issue).

**Spec**

* `bind(kernel)` registers one provider per port with `{ impl: 'default' }`; boot fails with the port name if a port from `provides` is unbound.
* Resolution order per request: kill switch, tenant flag rule, audience rule, default (PAP-366 order); the chosen `impl` is echoed as `X-PaperOS-Impl` on API responses and as a data attribute on slot fills.
* Consumers hold no reference across requests to a resolved request-scoped port.
* Shadow mode runs the secondary after the primary, never blocks the response, records `{ caseId, requestId, diff }` with a 1 percent sample by default.
* Disabling the module (PAP-266 `tenant_module`) unbinds its providers for that tenant; consumers with `requires[].optional=false` fail closed with `MODULE_DISABLED` (409).

**Interface contract**

Provides: `forge` bound in the kernel as `@paperos/contract-forge` provider `default`, flag `module.forge.impl`, manifest `slots.fills` and `events.subscribes` complete, `X-PaperOS-Impl` on this module's routes. Consumes: `@paperos/kernel` registry and DI (`module-system/registry-di`), flag swap mechanism (`module-system/flag-swap`), `@paperos/contract-forge@0.1` and its conformance suite, the implementation from PAP-276, PAP-47, PAP-366 flags, PAP-267 middleware for the header. Consumed by: every consumer of the contract (PAP-276 (forge client and oRPC procedures), PAP-51 (bootstrap), PAP-52 (release tags), PAP-97 (PR status back to Linear), PAP-278 (PR pages)), the swap CLI, PAP-266's removal matrix.

**Test plan**

* Unit: `bind` registers every port; unbound port fails boot with its name; request scope carries tenant and actor.
* Integration (compose stack): conformance suite passes against the kernel-resolved provider (not a direct import); flipping `module.forge.impl` to `next` for one tenant changes `X-PaperOS-Impl` for that tenant only within 5 s; kill switch returns `default`.
* Static: `pnpm gen:dep-map --undeclared` reports zero undeclared edges into `forge`; lint R8 error level; `knip` finds no unused exports left behind by the migration.
* Shadow: e2e run with `shadow: true` produces zero diffs between `default` and the `next` stub.
* E2E: the module's main flows (from its umbrella's Definition of done) pass unchanged after the migration; Gate 3 screenshots identical to baseline.

**Definition of done**

* Kernel binding merged; zero undeclared imports into `forge` across the monorepo; conformance green through the kernel; flag flip recording attached; shadow diff report empty.
* `docs/platform/modules.md` module page updated (bindings, flag, slots, events); dependency map regenerated and committed; Linear comment with the recording and report.

**Edge cases**

* A consumer that resolves a port at module-evaluation time: rewrite to lazy resolution; the lint flags top-level `kernel.resolve`.
* Flag service unavailable at boot: kernel falls back to `default`, never to `next`.
* Module disabled while a request is in flight: the request finishes on the old binding; the next request sees `MODULE_DISABLED`.

**Dependencies**

Blocked by `module/forge/contract`, `module/forge/conformance`, `module-system/registry-di`, `module-system/flag-swap` and PAP-276, PAP-47. Blocks nothing in Linear yet; it is a precondition for any future rewrite of this module.

*Round 4 (2026-09-18): PAP-276 soft: PAP-276 is deferred to v0.2 and must not block scheduled work; until it lands, wire the forge module with the adapters that exist (PAP-47, PAP-449, PAP-452); the forge client procedures join the adapter when PAP-276 is reinstated. The* `blocks` *relation PAP-276 -> PAP-455 was removed.*

**Agent**

Built by Forge (Version Control & Forge Independence owner). Reviewed by Sentinel and Forge (kernel).

**Size**

M

**Demo**

Reviewer flips `module.forge.impl` from `forgejo` to `github` for the demo tenant and the in-app repo browser (PAP-277) keeps working against GitHub; flips back. Ninety seconds.

*Round 4 amendment (2026-09-18):*

* Clarification: at merge time the second implementation is the `next` stub named in Scope; the `forgejo` to `github` flip described here becomes possible only when the read-only GitHub adapter from PAP-554 (deferred) is bound. Until then the demo flips `default` to `next` for the demo tenant and shows `X-PaperOS-Impl: next` on `forge.*` procedures.

*Round 4 critique fix (2026-09-18):* resolved 1 round-4 file key in this description to Linear identifiers: `r4/module-system/service-swap-drill` = PAP-554.
*Round 4 critique fix (2026-09-18):* PAP-276 appears in the Hard list above and in a round-4 soft note; it is soft (no `blocks` relation). Read the Hard list without it.

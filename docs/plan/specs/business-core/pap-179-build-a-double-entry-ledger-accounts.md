# PAP-179: Build a double-entry ledger (accounts, journal entries, periods) in Postgres with immutability guarantees

**Model / Effort:** set on children (umbrella is never claimed)

**Goal**

Build the double-entry ledger PaperOS owns: balanced journal entries against the chart of accounts, period controls, immutability of posted entries with reversals instead of edits, a tamper-evident hash chain, posting rules that translate business events into entries, and balances fast enough for reports. Every money-moving feature posts here. Umbrella for three children.

**Scope**

Children (M each, same milestone, Backlog):

* PAP-392 Journal tables, balance trigger, immutability trigger, gapless per-tenant numbering, `fin_account_balance` maintenance.
* PAP-393 Hash chain with nightly `verifyChain`, `ledger.reverse`, period close and lock workflow.
* PAP-394 Posting rule registry with the first five rules, `/finance/journal` UI, trial balance and `rebuildBalances`.

Out: report layouts (PAP-183), consolidation, inventory costing.

**Spec**

Decisions binding all children:

* `fin_journal_entry (id uuidv7, tenant_id, entry_number bigint per tenant, period_id, posted_at, effective_date, memo, status: draft|posted|reversed, source_type, source_id, transaction_id?, reversal_of_id?, reversed_by_id?, created_by, posted_by, prev_hash, hash, dimensions)`; `fin_journal_line (entry_id, line_no, account_id, party_id?, debit_minor, credit_minor, currency, fx_rate numeric(18,8), functional_minor, memo, dimensions)` with `CHECK ((debit_minor > 0) <> (credit_minor > 0))`.
* Posting runs in one SQL function under a per-tenant advisory lock: balance check on `functional_minor` (`UNBALANCED`), minimum two lines, active tenant accounts, next `entry_number`, `hash = sha256(prev_hash || canonical_json(entry, lines))`, incremental balance update.
* `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` on posted rows raises `IMMUTABLE_ENTRY`; the only path is `ledger.reverse`.
* Periods: `closed` needs `ledger.reopen`, `locked` rejects everything; close requires no drafts and a verified chain.
* `definePostingRule({ event, build(tx, ctx) => JournalDraft })` resolving accounts by `subtype`, never code; `ledger.postEvent(tx)` idempotent by `(source_type, source_id)`.
* Writes need `ledger.post`; agents may draft, not post, unless the character carries `ledger:post`.

**Interface contract**

Provides: `ledger.createDraft|post|reverse|list|trialBalance|verifyChain|rebuildBalances|postEvent`, `definePostingRule`, `JournalDraft` type, `AccountSubtype` usage rules, dataset `finance.journal`, event `ledger.entry.posted { entryId, sourceType, sourceId }`, error codes `UNBALANCED`, `IMMUTABLE_ENTRY`, `PERIOD_LOCKED`. Consumes: accounts, periods, transactions, `Money` (PAP-175), RLS (PAP-34), audit (PAP-38), grid (PAP-165), `can()` (PAP-227), observability for chain alerts (PAP-40). Consumed by PAP-180, PAP-181, PAP-182, PAP-183, PAP-184, PAP-185, PAP-196, PAP-206.

**Definition of done**

* All three children Done.
* Concurrency: 50 parallel posts keep `entry_number` gapless and the chain valid.
* Playwright: draft, post, reverse, close period; screenshots at 375, 1024, 1920 in three themes.
* `docs/finance/ledger.md` with the rule catalogue and invariants; ADR on immutability and hash chain; CHANGELOG; Linear comment with `verifyChain` output.

**Test plan**

Umbrella `ledger.e2e.test.ts` on Postgres: post 10k random balanced entries across two currencies from 50 workers; assert gapless numbering, balances equal a brute-force sum per account and period, `verifyChain` passes; tamper one row as superuser and assert the first mismatch is reported; reverse an entry and assert mirrored lines and both statuses; close a period and assert `PERIOD_LOCKED` on a backdated post; run every registered rule against its fixture transaction and assert the draft balances.

**Demo**

Reviewer opens `/finance/journal`, creates a two-line manual entry (Post disabled until balanced), posts it, tries to edit and sees the immutability error, reverses it with a reason, then runs `pnpm ledger verify demo` printing the chain result. Under two minutes.

**Edge cases**

* Multi-currency entry balances in functional currency; rounding remainder posts to `fx_gain_loss`.
* Three-way split uses `Money.allocate`, never off by a cent.
* Reversal of a reversal allowed, both linked.
* Import backdating into a closed period: rejected with an offer to post on period start.
* Tenant hard delete: ledger rows move to an archive schema for the retention period.

**Dependencies**

PAP-175 (hard), PAP-34, PAP-38, PAP-165 (journal UI), PAP-59 children. Blocks PAP-180, PAP-181, PAP-183, PAP-184, PAP-185, PAP-196, PAP-206.

**Agent**

Builder: Ledger (Bookkeeper). Reviewer: Sentinel (Security Auditor for immutability, Code Reviewer), Forge (Schema Wright) for triggers.

**Size**

L, split into three M children plus a dedicated adversarial review.

**Pending issues**

Bracketed references above are fully specified work packages that Linear refused to create on 2026-09-17 (`USAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, free-plan issue cap). Their specs live in the project document(s) [business-core](<https://linear.app/paperos/document/round-2-pending-issues-business-core-11-7c8c2526b3c9>) and they are created as issues by `round2/agent4/create_issues.py` once the workspace plan is upgraded.

**Module boundary**

This umbrella is the Business Core: Payments, Finance & Payroll half of the PaperOS Module System (`docs/module-system.md`). The `business-core` module implements `@paperos/contract-business-core` (finance model, ledger and posting rules, billing, payments, tax and payroll provider ports, document port, entitlements, usage metering). Growth, migration and dashboards post to the ledger and read entitlements only through these ports; Stripe and payroll SDKs are imported nowhere else. The module may import `@paperos/core`, `contract-data-layer`, `contract-identity`, `contract-tables` and its own package. Its manifest declares `provides: [{ contract: '@paperos/contract-business-core', version: '0.1.0' }]`, `owner: { agent: 'Ledger', project: 'business-core' }` and `swapRisk: 'high'`. The contract package is published by PAP-484 (`module/business-core/contract`), proven by PAP-487 (`module/business-core/conformance`) and bound into `@paperos/kernel` by PAP-490 (`module/business-core/wire`); children of this issue inherit this boundary and may not add a dependency the manifest does not declare (lint rules R7 to R11).

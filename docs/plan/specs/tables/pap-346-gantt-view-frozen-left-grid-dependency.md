# PAP-346: Gantt view: frozen left grid, dependency arrows, critical path, progress and working days

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) / high — Build M

**Goal**

Turn the timeline into a Gantt with a task grid, finish-to-start dependencies, critical path highlighting and working-day scheduling.

**Scope**

In: `views/time/{GanttView,deps,criticalPath,workdays}.tsx`. Out: resource levelling.

**Spec**

* Left grid (title, start, end, duration, assignee) reusing PAP-165 cells; dependencies from a self-relation field drawn as SVG paths; create by dragging a connector handle; delete via context menu.
* Dragging a bar with dependents offers "shift dependents" (Alt skips); cycles rejected with explanation; imported cycles dashed red.
* Critical path is the longest path, recomputed client-side; `progressField` fills bars; weekends shaded and skipped when `workingDays` set.

**Interface contract**

Provides: `<GanttView />`, `criticalPath(items, deps)`, `shiftDependents`. Consumes: timeline child, PAP-165 cells, relation type (PAP-164).

**Definition of done**

* Unit tests for critical path and working-day maths; Playwright dependency create and shift; replay at 1024 and 1920; screenshots at five widths.

**Test plan**

* Unit: longest path on fixtures; cycle detection; working-day arithmetic.
* E2E: add dependency, shift, reject cycle; keyboard-only reschedule.

**Demo**

Draw a dependency between two bars in `/demo/gantt` and move the predecessor.

**Edge cases**

* Zero-duration after resize clamps and warns; under 768 px the left grid hides.

**Dependencies**

Timeline child (hard), PAP-165, PAP-164.

**Agent**

Builder: Nova. Reviewer: Sentinel (Edge Case Hunter).

**Size**

M: one session.

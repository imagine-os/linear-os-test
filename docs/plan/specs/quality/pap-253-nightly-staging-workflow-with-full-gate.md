# PAP-253: Nightly staging workflow with full gate run

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) / high — Build M

**Goal**

Deploy `main` to staging every night through Coolify, run the full suites (e2e `@full`, visual matrix, edge-case library, perf), and write a nightly report so the RC on Monday starts from known-good evidence.

**Scope**

* In: `.github/workflows/staging-nightly.yml` at 02:00 UTC and `workflow_dispatch`, Coolify deploy step with status polling and smoke (`/healthz`, `/__version` equals SHA), pre-deploy backup call and snapshot id capture, migrations via `drizzle-kit migrate`, suite invocations, `reports/nightly-<date>.json` aggregate in the contracts shape, failure notification comment on a pinned "Nightly" Linear issue.
* Out: RC cut and promotion (sibling), the suites themselves.

**Spec**

* Deploy: `POST /api/v1/deploy?uuid=<staging>` with bearer secret; poll deployment status until `finished` (cap 15 minutes); smoke checks; on failure stop and report.
* Backup: call PAP-30's backup script before migrations, record `snapshotId`.
* Suites: PAP-86 `@full` including 375 run, PAP-82 full 21 combinations, PAP-85 nightly library, PAP-87 informational Pages run, API perf smoke when available.
* Aggregate: `{ date, sha, deploy: { status, durationMs }, suites: [{ name, status, reportUrl }], trends }`; three consecutive nights of reports are the DoD evidence.
* Notification: comment on the pinned Linear issue via PAP-97 with a one-line status and links; red nights also open a task for Atlas.

*Round 4 amendment (2026-09-18):*

* Nightly schedule table (round 4): the self-hosted runner pool is shared, so nightly jobs are staggered and documented in `ops/ci/nightly-schedule.yaml`: 02:00 UTC staging deploy and `@full` e2e (this issue), 02:40 visual 21-combination run, 03:00 PAP-80 full-history scans and PAP-110 evals (capped at 4 runners), 03:30 DAST baseline, 04:00 edge-case library (PAP-251), 04:30 API fuzzing, 05:00 PAP-306 plan audit on Mondays, 05:30 perf smoke. A job that starts while a heavier one is running waits on a concurrency group `nightly-heavy` rather than contending; the aggregate report records queue time per suite.

**Interface contract**

* Provides: nightly report artifact and Pages URL `/nightly/<date>/`, `deployToEnvironment(name, sha)` composite action reused by the RC sibling, staging trend data for PAP-89.
* Requires: sibling policy (`environments.yaml`), PAP-26 images and Coolify, PAP-30 backup script, PAP-86, PAP-82, PAP-85, PAP-97.

**Definition of done**

* Three consecutive nightly runs with reports (links).
* Seeded failing deploy (bad SHA) stops before suites and reports `deploy: failed` (link).
* `deployToEnvironment` reused by the RC workflow (PR reference).
* Docs section "Nightly".

**Test plan**

* Unit: aggregate writer, status polling with fake responses.
* Integration: `workflow_dispatch` rehearsal against staging.

**Demo**

Trigger `workflow_dispatch` on `staging-nightly`, watch the deploy step finish, then open the nightly report page for that date. Two minutes of watching after the run.

**Edge cases**

* Migration fails: no app rollout; report flags it; snapshot id retained for restore.
* Coolify API down: retry 30 minutes then fail loudly.
* Suites exceed runner capacity: sequential fallback with a duration warning.

**Dependencies**

Sibling policy child (hard), PAP-26 (hard). Soft: PAP-30, PAP-86, PAP-82, PAP-85, PAP-97.

**Agent**

Built by Forge (Ops Runner) with Sentinel. Reviewed by Atlas.

# PAP-422: Round-trip `paperos` connector: import a PaperOS archive into an empty tenant and verify counts and hashes table by table

**Model / Effort:** Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) / high — Build M

**Goal**

Prove the export is complete by re-importing it: a `paperos` `SourceConnector` that reads the v1.0 archive, recreates schema, views, records, docs, files and comments with identities preserved through `system: paperos` mappings, and a verification script that compares source and target hash by hash.

**Scope**

In: `connectors/paperos/` reading the zip stream; schema-first application (tables, fields, views) then data, docs, files, comments, PM, CRM; ledger restored through `ledger.importJournal` (reversing rules respected); `scripts/export-roundtrip.ts` producing `reports/roundtrip.json`; tenant-to-tenant move documented in `docs/migration/export-format.md`.

Out: UI (child 2), format (child 1).

**Spec**

* Identities: `external_id = original record id`, so a restore into the same tenant updates rather than duplicates.
* Files verified by sha256 before linking; mismatch listed.
* Verification compares row counts, per-table content hashes (sorted canonical JSON) and file hashes.

*Round 4 amendment (2026-09-18):*
Round 4: `ledger.importJournal` does not exist in PAP-179 or its children. Restore ledger history through `ledger.postEvent` with `source_type: 'import'`, `source_id: '<run_id>:<entry_number>'` (idempotent per the contracts document) and a `JournalDraft` per archived entry; reversal on rollback uses `ledger.reverseRun` from PAP-425. A batch `importJournal(entries[])` convenience is requested from business-core as a Spec issue (see cross-project suggestions) and adopted when it lands.

**Interface contract**

Provides: `registerConnector('paperos', ...)`, `verifyRoundTrip(source, target): RoundTripReport`, CLI `pnpm paperos import --connector paperos --file export.zip`. Consumes: children 1 and 2, PAP-199 engine, PAP-201 mappings, PAP-179 `importJournal` (soft). Named precondition for tenant hard-delete in PAP-33.

**Definition of done**

* Demo tenant exported, imported into an empty tenant, and `roundtrip.json` shows zero mismatches (report attached).
* Restore into the same tenant is idempotent (zero creates on second run).

**Test plan**

* Vitest: archive reader, schema-first ordering, identity mapping, hash comparison including field-type edge cases (currency minor units, dates with zones, relations).
* Integration in CI: small fixture archive round-trips in under 60 s.
* Nightly job on staging round-trips the demo tenant and posts the report.

**Demo**

Reviewer runs `pnpm paperos export --tenant demo`, then `pnpm paperos import --connector paperos --file demo.zip --tenant empty`, then `pnpm export:verify demo empty` and reads a report with all green rows. Under two minutes on the fixture tenant.

**Edge cases**

* Archive from a newer format version: refused with the version and an upgrade hint.
* Target tenant already has a table of the same name: merge fields, never change existing types.
* Ledger periods closed in the target: journals land in the current open period with a note.

**Dependencies**

Children 1 and 2 (hard), PAP-199 children 1 and 2 (hard), PAP-201, PAP-179 (soft).

**Agent**

Built by Scout (Import Mapper) with Ledger for journal restore. Reviewed by Sentinel (Edge Case Hunter) and Atlas.

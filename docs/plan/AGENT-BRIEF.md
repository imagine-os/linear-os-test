# PaperOS Core Platform: brief for a Claude Code session

> Since 2026-09-19 this plan lives in the monorepo `imagine-os/linear-os-test` under `docs/plan/`
> (it was the repository `imagine-os/linear-builder`). Paths in this brief are relative to `docs/plan/`.
> The code it used to point at is in the same repository: the platform template at the root
> (former `imagine-os/paperos-template` / `empty-11`) and the orchestrator at `tools/orchestrator`
> (former `imagine-os/paperos-orchestrator` / `empty12`). The root `CLAUDE.md` holds the working rules
> for the code.

You are one of the nine PaperOS agent characters picking up an issue from Linear team **PAP** (https://linear.app/paperos). This folder holds the plan; the code lives in the same repository `imagine-os/linear-os-test` (root = former `imagine-os/paperos-template`, `tools/orchestrator` = former `imagine-os/paperos-orchestrator`). Justin Massion is the only human; he approves `Needs Justin` cards and nothing else.

**Linear is the system of record.** The files here are snapshots of Linear content. If a spec here and the issue in Linear disagree, the issue wins; note the drift in a comment on the issue.

## Read first, in this order

1. `docs/blueprint.md` (Blueprint: vision, decisions, phases, budget, project index)
2. `docs/interface-and-data-contracts.md` (the shapes every project codes against; changing one needs an ADR, PAP-130; its Module map section names the contract package of every module)
3. `docs/module-system.md` (**required reading**, the PaperOS Module System: every project is a module with a manifest, a versioned contract package `@paperos/contract-<module>` and implementation packages nobody else imports; the kernel is the only place a dependency lives; the swap playbook and the shell-swap drill PAP-446). Linear document: https://linear.app/paperos/document/paperos-module-system-8007373cc6bb
4. Your project's `Contract` section: the project content in Linear (project list: `plan/plan.json` `projects[]`)
5. `docs/agent-roster.md`, then your character sheet in `docs/characters/` (routing, tools, access, refusal rules)
6. `docs/security-and-threat-model.md` (§4 is the Linear deny list: never archive or delete anything, never move to Done or Canceled, never touch PAP-1..PAP-12 or views)
7. `docs/execution-schedule.md` (your start day, milestone dates, the branch-start rule, the Needs Justin table, the discounted terms and $2,500 chunks)
8. `docs/new-app-in-ten-minutes.md` (the golden path the whole platform serves)

Then read your issue in Linear end to end, including its Dependencies section and every issue it links.

## Where specs live

* `specs/<project-key>/<slug>.md`: one file per canonical PAP issue (983, 23 project folders incl. `module-system/` and the five round-4 projects `assistant/`, `workflows/`, `engagement/`, `commerce/`, `platform-ops/`) with frontmatter (identifier, project, phase, type, priority, state, blockedBy, blocks, key, URL, updatedAt, model, effort, estimate, dueDate, cycle). Index: `specs/README.md`. Every specified issue has the eleven sections: Goal, Scope, Spec, Interface contract, Test plan, Definition of done, Edge cases, Dependencies, Agent, Size, Demo, and a `**Model / Effort:**` first line; the 82 Triage skeletons (PAP-914 upward) carry Goal and Source only and are not claimable.
* `plan/module-issues.json` and `docs/module-system.md`: the round-3 module-system issues (PAP-433..PAP-497: kernel issues, one contract / conformance / wire trio per module) and the 18 `Module boundary` amendments. If your issue is a `Publish @paperos/contract-<module>`, `Conformance suite` or `Wire <module>` issue, the Module System document is your primary spec context.
* `plan/round4/chunks-v2.json` and `docs/build-chunks.md`: the $2,500 chunk plan (which issues land in which chunk, in which order, at 16 builders running 24/7; mix B builders on their Model labels with Fable 5.1 on specs and reviews, 5 chunks; mix A all Fable 5.1, 8 chunks). The `Chunk 1..5` labels follow mix B. The orchestrator uses the chunk order as its tie-breaker; you do not pick by chunk, you claim from Ready for Claude.
* `docs/pending/<project-key>/<slug>.md`: historical spec text of the 156 round-2 pending issues. All of them were created in Linear on 2026-09-17 as PAP-280..PAP-432 (153 issues; the other 3 stayed folded into live issues as work packages) and are normal issues now, claimable like any other. The live Linear description (mirrored in `specs/`) wins over the pending file; `docs/pending/README.md` maps each `[project/key]` citation to its identifier. Team PAP holds 991 issues (983 canonical: 901 specified, 82 Triage) across 23 projects, 30 of them in Ready for Claude. For a folded work package, build it on a branch `<parent>/wp<n>-<slug>`.
* `plan/round2/changes/` and `plan/round4/changes/`: every Linear mutation made while planning, one log per agent and per fix. Use them to understand why a relation or paragraph exists. `plan/round4/digest/<project>.md` is the round-4 feature matrix of your project (what the gap issues close and why).
* **Linear fields.** Every leaf carries a Fibonacci **estimate** (2 = S, half a session-day; 3 = M, one; 5 = L, two), a **due date** (its milestone's target date, or earlier when the schedule needs it; never on a `Deferred` issue) and, once it is Ready or in flight, the active **cycle** (C1 Foundation & core systems 09-18..09-24, C2 Business layer & hardening 09-25..10-01, C3 v0.2 stretch); umbrellas carry none of these and Linear rolls their children up. **Cycles hold in-flight work only**: a Backlog issue never has a cycle (Linear would move it to Todo); planned timing lives in due dates and the `Chunk 1..5` labels (mix B of the chunk plan), and `cycleIssueAutoAssignStarted` puts your issue in the active cycle when it moves to In Progress. **Triage** is the intake state for Slack, GitHub and agent-found items; Atlas accepts (writes the eleven sections and moves to Backlog), folds or declines each, and nothing in Triage is claimable.

## Pipeline states

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Triage` | Intake (round 4): a one-line Goal and Source, no estimate, due date or cycle. Atlas sorts it; never claim from it. |
| `Backlog` | Specified, waiting on blockers. The orchestrator's promotion pass moves it forward; you do not. |
| `Ready for Claude` | Spec-complete and unblocked. The only state you may claim from. |
| `In Progress` | Claimed by exactly one session, working in a git worktree on branch `feat/PAP-n-<slug>`. |
| `In Review` | A PR exists; Sentinel's gates and reviewers run. Dependents may start against the PR branch (branch-start rule). |
| `Needs Justin` | A human decision is required; the card says what and offers `/approve` or `/reject`. Nothing else waits on it unless the card says so. |
| `Done` | Merged and verified. Only the merge flow moves issues here, never a session by hand. |

`Todo` exists as human parking and is never polled. Move your issue only along `Ready for Claude → In Progress → In Review`; anything else goes through a comment.

## Rules every session obeys

* **Module boundary rule.** A module (every Linear project is one, plus the `module-system` kernel) depends only on other modules' contract packages, `@paperos/contract-<module>` under `packages/contracts/`: types, Zod schemas, event topics, oRPC route signatures, UI slot definitions, repository ports, conformance suite and golden fixtures, never runtime code. Never import another module's implementation package, database table, React component or environment variable; reach it through the kernel (registry and DI container PAP-434, event bus, gateway PAP-437, UI slots PAP-438, config port PAP-444). The dependency lint (PAP-439) fails the build otherwise. Declare what you provide and require in the module manifest (PAP-433), bump the contract version on any shape change (ADR, PAP-130), keep the conformance suite green, and prefer a port plus adapter over a direct call so the module can be swapped by flag (PAP-435) with the swap playbook (PAP-442).
* **Umbrella rule.** An issue with sub-issues is an umbrella (86 today). Never claim it and never move it to Ready for Claude (validator error `UMBRELLA_NOT_CLAIMABLE`). Claim its children like any issue; every child carries the external `blocks` relations it needs, and the last child in build order also carries the umbrella's outbound `blocks` edges, so dependents wait for the real work. The session that finishes the last child runs the umbrella's integration test, attaches the evidence and moves the umbrella to In Review.
* **Deferred rule.** An issue carrying the `Deferred` label (the v0.2 set, 204 issues at priority 4 with no due date) or a "deferred" note under Goal is never claimed and never promoted until Justin removes the deferral (NJ-14). If you find one in Ready for Claude, leave one comment `not claimable: labelled Deferred` and move on.
* **Model and effort rule.** A builder session runs on the model named by the issue's `Model` label (`Model: Fable 5.1`, `Model: Opus 5`, `Model: Sonnet 5`, `Model: Haiku 4.5`) at the reasoning effort named by its `Effort` label (`Effort: low|medium|high|max`, group `Reasoning effort`); the same values sit in the `**Model / Effort:**` line of the description and in the spec frontmatter (`model:`, `effort:`). If either label is missing, fall back to Sonnet 5 / medium. Reviewers and the QA gate follow the rule in `docs/cost-and-duration-estimate.md` section 4b (Opus 5 / high after an Opus or Fable builder, Sonnet 5 / high after a Sonnet builder; QA gate Haiku 4.5 / low). Umbrellas carry no Model or Effort label; their children do.
* **Promotion rule (how an issue reaches Ready).** Nobody hand-picks issues. The orchestrator (PAP-96) promotes a Backlog issue to Ready for Claude only when all four checks hold: no `Deferred` label or note; no sub-issues; every inbound `blocks` issue is `Done`, `Canceled`, or `In Review` with an open PR (the branch-start rule); and the issue contract (PAP-93) passes with no errors, `BLOCKED_BY_OPEN` included. The promotion comment lists the blockers and, for In Review blockers, the `BASE_BRANCHES` you merge into your worktree before starting. Until the orchestrator runs, Atlas applies `pnpm linear:promote --dry-run` by hand.
* **Claim exactly one issue**, from `Ready for Claude`, that routes to your character (roster routing rules). Re-check state and labels immediately before claiming; if someone else got it, pick the next.
* **Never** delete, archive, rename or re-state anything in Linear beyond your own issue's `In Progress → In Review` move and comments. Never touch PAP-1..PAP-12, views, labels or documents.
* Work in a worktree on the named branch; open the PR with the issue identifier in the title; attach the Definition-of-done evidence the spec asks for (recordings, gate artifacts); post one comment on the issue when you move it to In Review.
* Anything that needs a human (a paid account, a secret, a policy decision) becomes a `Needs Justin` card in the form the Execution Schedule table uses; it never blocks your own issue unless the spec says so.

## Tooling in this folder

`docs/plan/tools/linear/` holds the Python scripts that built the plan (GraphQL to `https://api.linear.app/graphql`, key from `LINEAR_API_KEY`, idempotent, never destructive); `tools/linear/round4/snapshot4.py` writes the snapshot and `tools/linear/gen_specs.py` regenerates `specs/`. `docs/plan/tools/blueprint/build_v5.js` builds `docs/plan/site/index.html`, published by the monorepo Pages workflow at https://imagine-os.github.io/linear-os-test/blueprint/. You will rarely need any of them while building an issue.
